To run this program, you need to have Yarn and Node.js installed on your laptop.

After installed them, go to the project file in terminal and type "yarn start", the project will run.

This is a Web App of a resturant that you can see their menu. 

I follow some parts of this tutorial: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-first-react-js-application/learn/lecture/18846270#overview
It helps me to build the web page.
The file Header.js, Footer.js, Navigation.js, part of NavigationMenu.js are built based on the tutorial.
The file App.js, Home.js, Rice.js, Noodle.js, Stir.js, Others.js, Drink.js, and the imgaes folder are done by myself.
Every other files generated automatically when I created the project.

*IMPORTANT: 
This Web App has a bug that if you click on the link, the web content will not refresh automatically.
However, the link path on the top will update. 
So remember to refresh the page after you click on any link.
